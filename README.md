# Mercor-hackathon
# Description :point_left:
A React and Chakra UI Based Website with API endpoints.
This website will act as a platform for AI based interviews where certain question
responses will be given as audio by the candidate and it can be analyzed for behavioural 
features by using GPT Model created using OpenAI, the speech to text rendering id done
using AssemblyAI where the audio is send as a parameter and the text given by its processing
is passed onto backend API and the behavioural response is rendered on UI accordingly.
The TTS (Text to Speech) feature can also be used by the readers who have visual
imparity. This also helps in providing the users with the hands-free feature so they
can give the interview with ease.

candidiate response based on factors provided in the OpenAI model and as wel as using AssemblyAI 
certain other features like sentiment and entity detection can also be done. It can be used for hiring
purposes by various companies accordingly.
